# Custom-UNIX-Shell-Operating-System-
custom unix system implemented using c langauge to create three specific commands for c shell 
1) word: It is a built-in (internal) command, Reads the number of words (assume word is a “space-separated” string) in a text file, and throws an error if the file does not exist. 
Syntax: word [-option] [file_name]
Note: if no option is passed then there should be only one file, the number of files may vary as per option and the same would reflect in syntax .
It should additionally also cater 2 options:
-n : ignores new line character 
-d : difference between the word sizes of two text files
Note: Only one of the options (-n or -d) can be used at a time with the word command.


2) dir: It creates a directory, and then changes the path to that directory. It is an external command, throw an error if that directory already exists.
Syntax: dir [-option] [dir_name]
It should additionally also cater 2 options:
-r : removes if the directory already exists and create a new directory instead of throwing an error  
-v : print a message for each step in the running of this command
3) date: It returns the last modified date and time of a particular file.  It is an external command
Syntax: date [-option] [file_name]
It should additionally also cater 2 options:
-d : display time described by STRING 
-R : output date and time in RFC 5322 format
